# SSH Bruteforce Attempts

## Overview

This repository contains lists of IP addresses that attempted SSH bruteforce attacks over a period of one month, validated using data from [AbuseIPDB](https://abuseipdb.com/). The lists provided are:

- **alltrylist-badips.txt**: Lists IP addresses along with the number of attempts made.
- **oneip-badips.txt**: Lists unique IP addresses, removing duplicates for easy analysis.

These lists are valuable for identifying potential security threats and can be used to enhance system security by blocking or restricting access to these IP addresses through firewall rules or other security measures.
